        "description": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common and most serious valve disease problems. With AS, the opening of the aortic heart valve narrows. As a result, the heart needs to work harder and may not pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. Aortic stenosis can be caused by a birth defect, rheumatic fever, radiation therapy or can be related to age. Approximately 2.5 million people in the United States over the age of 75 suffer from this disease. In elderly patients, aortic stenosis is sometimes caused by the buildup up calcium (mineral deposits) on the aortic valve’s leaflets. Over time, the leaflets become stiff, which reduces their ability to fully open and close. When the leaflets don’t fully open, a person’s heart must work harder to push blood through the aortic valve to the rest of the body. As a result, less oxygen-rich blood flows from the lungs to the brain and rest of the body, which may cause symptoms. ",
